		<h2>Goals</h2>
		<div style="display:none">
			<p>
			This Kata has three separate goals:
			</p>
			<ol>
			<li>As you&#8217;re coding each algorithm, keep a note of the kinds of error
			you encounter. A binary search is a ripe breeding ground for &quot;off by
			one&quot; and fencepost errors. As you progress through the week, see if
			the frequency of these errors decreases (that is, do you learn from
			experience in one technique when it comes to coding with a different
			technique?).
			</li>
			<li>What can you say about the relative merits of the various techniques
			you&#8217;ve chosen? Which is the most likely to make it in to production
			code? Which was the most fun to write? Which was the hardest to get
			working? And for all these questions, ask yourself &quot;why?&quot;.
			</li>
			<li>It&#8217;s fairly hard to come up with five unique approaches to a binary
			chop. How did you go about coming up with approaches four and five? What
			techniques did you use to fire those &quot;off the wall&quot; neurons?
			</li>
			</ol>
			<h2>Specification</h2>
			<p>
			Write a binary chop method that takes an integer search target and a sorted
			array of integers. It should return the integer index of the target in the
			array, or -1 if the target is not in the array. The signature will
			logically be:
